# Java

### Language purpose / genesis

1) **Why was the language created?**
2) **What problems was the language trying to address?**
3) **Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?**

### Unique features of the language

1) **Does the language have any particularly unique features?**

### Name spaces

1) **How are name spaces implemented?**
2) **How are name spaces used?**

### Types

1) **What types does the language support?**
2) **Are both reference and value types supported?**
3) **Can new value types be created?**

### Classes

1) **Defining**
2) **Creating new instances**
3) **Constructing / initializing**
4) **Destructing / de-initializing**

### Instance reference name in data type (class)

1) **This? Self?**

### Properties

1) **Getters and setters…write your own or built in?**
2) **Backing variables?**
3) **Computed properties?**

### Interfaces / protocols

1) **What does the language support?**
2) **What abilities does it have?**
3) **How is it used?**

### Inheritance / extension
### Reflection

1) **What reflection abilities are supported?**
2) **How is reflection used?**

### Memory management

1) **How is it handled?**
2) **How does it work?**
3) **Garbage collection?**
4) **Automatic reference counting?**

### Comparisons of references and values

1) **How are values compared? (i.e. comparing two strings)**

### Null / nil references

1) **Which does the language use? (null/nil/etc)**
2) **Does the language have features for handling null/nil references?**

### Errors and exception handling
### Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types
### Implementation of listeners and event handlers
### Singleton

1) **How is a singleton implemented?**
2) **Can it be made thread-safe?**
3) **Can the singleton instance be lazily instantiated?**

### Procedural programming

1) **Does the language support procedural programming?**

### Functional programming

1) **Does the language support functional programming?**

### Multithreading

1) **Threads or thread-like abilities**
2) **How is multitasking accomplished?**
