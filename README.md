# Java

### Language purpose / genesis

1) **Why was the language created?**
   * Java was created to use as few dependencies as possible while being a language built to be used across all platforms. Java Virtual Machine is a large part of what allows it to be used across platforms.
2) **What problems was the language trying to address?**
   * Memory management was the main issue that was trying to be addressed by Java. A garbage collection system was implemented to help with this problem. Java also helps simplify some of the complexity of other languages with its use of different libraries and built in functions.
3) **Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?**
   * Java was a reaction to the previous dominant language of C++. It tried to fix some of the problems associated with C++, but while still using the OO concepts.

### Unique features of the language

1) **Does the language have any particularly unique features?**
   * One of the unique features of Java is the Java Virtual Machine.  It also is very flexible and can be ran on multiple platforms.

### Name spaces

1) **How are name spaces implemented?**
   * Defining a package: `package final;`
   * You can also import other packages and that would look like: `import java.io;`
2) **How are name spaces used?**
   * They help group related classes by defining a namespace.  This helps to avoid naming conflicts and keep things organized. Packages are defined at the top of the page and will define which package the class belongs to.

### Types

1) **What types does the language support?**
2) **Are both reference and value types supported?**
3) **Can new value types be created?**

### Classes

1) **Defining**
2) **Creating new instances**
3) **Constructing / initializing**
4) **Destructing / de-initializing**

### Instance reference name in data type (class)

1) **This? Self?**

### Properties

1) **Getters and setters…write your own or built in?**
2) **Backing variables?**
3) **Computed properties?**

### Interfaces / protocols

1) **What does the language support?**
2) **What abilities does it have?**
3) **How is it used?**

### Inheritance / extension
### Reflection

1) **What reflection abilities are supported?**
2) **How is reflection used?**

### Memory management

1) **How is it handled?**
2) **How does it work?**
3) **Garbage collection?**
4) **Automatic reference counting?**

### Comparisons of references and values

1) **How are values compared? (i.e. comparing two strings)**

### Null / nil references

1) **Which does the language use? (null/nil/etc)**
2) **Does the language have features for handling null/nil references?**

### Errors and exception handling
### Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types
### Implementation of listeners and event handlers
### Singleton

1) **How is a singleton implemented?**
2) **Can it be made thread-safe?**
3) **Can the singleton instance be lazily instantiated?**

### Procedural programming

1) **Does the language support procedural programming?**

### Functional programming

1) **Does the language support functional programming?**

### Multithreading

1) **Threads or thread-like abilities**
2) **How is multitasking accomplished?**
